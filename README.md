# Chinese checkers with concept learning
The main porpuse of this project is to build a chinese checkers player (or learner), who get the skill from the data
retrieved of the game board (which has been simplified). 
The performace of the task is measured by the portion of games wonned over the quantity of games played.

## Prerequisites
- numpy (1.16.3)
- python (3.7.2)
## Usage
```python
python $games $fit_frecuency oponent_version #oponent_version: 0 -> random, 1 -> old version of the player
```
## Conclusions (so far)
The approach has not succeed.
The main reasons could be: the problem itself (is it capable of be learned?), the model selected, other issues no noticed.
